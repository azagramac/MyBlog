WARNING: Image reference repository/my-image:tag uses a tag, not a digest, to identify the image to sign.
    This can lead you to sign a different image than the intended one. Please use a
    digest (example.com/ubuntu@sha256:abc123...) rather than tag
    (example.com/ubuntu:latest) for the input to cosign. The ability to refer to
    images by tag will be removed in a future release.
